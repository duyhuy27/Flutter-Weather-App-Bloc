# Flutter Weather App with Bloc

A simple Flutter project demonstrating the use of the Bloc pattern for state management and interaction with the OpenWeatherMap API. The app allows users to get weather information based on their current location or by searching for a specific city. It utilizes the following packages:

- [weather](https://pub.dev/packages/weather): A Flutter package for fetching weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.
- [intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl): Provides internationalization and localization support.
- [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc): Implements the Bloc pattern for state management.
- [geolocator](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator): Provides geolocation services.
- [equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable): Simplifies equality comparisons and toString implementations.

## Features

- **Bloc Pattern:** Utilizes the Bloc pattern for a clean and scalable state management solution.
- **Weather API Integration:** Fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Location Services:** Uses the Geolocator package to get the current device location.
- **Internationalization:** Implements localization and internationalization with the Intl package.
